# Hey.

Hey! I’m Joe, software engineer & NYC native (Does Staten Island count?). I’ve grown up around technology most of my life, and currently trying to make the world a better place at DoSomething.org

I created this space to talk about the projects I'm working on and document them. Feel free to read about some of them below!
