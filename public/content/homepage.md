# Hey.

My name is Joe. I'm native to NYC if you think Staten Island counts. I'm old enough to vote for Hillary but young enough I couldn't legally drink afterwards. I grew up surrounded by computers, robots & clocked more hours in Minecraft than you ever will. I then somehow convinced people to give me a job out of high school, and since then I've been trying to make the world a better place as a Software Engineer at DoSomething.org.

I created this space to talk about the projects I'm working on and document them. Feel free to read about some of them below!
